# PlaneEarthMap - Innovative Map Projections for the Digital Age

🌍 **[Deutsch](README.md)** | 🇺🇸 **[English](README.en.md)** | 🇪🇸 **[Español](README.es.md)**

## 🌍 Project Vision

PlaneEarthMap revolutionizes digital cartography through alternative Earth projections that eliminate traditional Mercator projection distortions. Our GPU-accelerated rendering system enables real-time calculations of complex projection algorithms and offers the world's first seamless bidirectional navigation.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **🗺️ Alternative Projections**: Planar, convex, and concave Earth models for distortion-free representation
- **🔄 Seamless Navigation**: World's first bidirectional infinite scrolling (North-South + East-West)
- **⚡ GPU Rendering**: High-performance real-time map rendering with external GPU servers
- **🌐 Federated Architecture**: Decentralized map infrastructure via ActivityPub protocol
- **📱 ARM64 Optimized**: Mobile-first design for modern smartphone architecture
- **🔓 Open Source**: Community-driven development under AGPL v3 license

## ⚖️ The Distortion Problem

Traditional map projections lead to significant size distortions:
- **Russia** appears about twice as large as **Africa**, although Africa is actually 1.3 times larger
- **Greenland** appears larger than entire continents
- These distortions can lead to **geopolitical misunderstandings**

PlaneEarthMap corrects these issues through area-accurate planar projections.

## 🎓 Scientific Foundation

### Developmental Psychology Basis
Studies from the **University of Illinois** show that children naturally perceive Earth as a flat surface. PlaneEarthMap supports this natural spatial development through:
- Age-appropriate planar map representations
- Gradual transition to more complex geometric concepts
- Promoting geographic understanding without cognitive dissonance
